# Mahamed Mahamed :computer:

I am a **backend-focused system developer** with a strong interest in **business-critical systems, data, and scalable architectures**.  
I enjoy working where **technology meets real-world processes**, and I thrive in structured environments that require discipline, system thinking, and problem solving.

Currently studying system and software development and actively seeking **LIA (internship)** opportunities within backend, data, cloud, and business-oriented systems.

- REST APIs
- SQL (data modeling, queries, optimization)
- Entity Framework
- System integration & backend logic

**Cloud & Infrastructure**
- Azure (fundamentals, app services, databases)
- Cloud-oriented architecture thinking
- CI/CD basics

**General**
- Git & GitHub
- Agile / Scrum
- System documentation
- Clean, maintainable code

## check out my github portfolio :briefcase:

Below are repositories that reflect my **learning path, backend focus, and system mindset**.

| repository | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `backend-api-project` | REST API with structured layers, business logic & validation |
| `sql-data-modeling` | Relational data modeling, normalization & queries |
| `dotnet-backend-core` | .NET backend fundamentals, services & architecture |
| `cloud-ready-app` | Backend prepared for cloud deployment (Azure-oriented) |
| `system-design-notes` | Notes & diagrams on system flows and architecture |

> My repositories focus on **clarity, structure, and reasoning** — not just code.

## how I think about development :brain:

I approach development like a **system**, not isolated features.

- Understand the **business need first**
- Design clean data structures
- Build backend logic that is predictable and scalable
- Prefer correctness, clarity, and maintainability over shortcuts
- Use data as the foundation for decisions

SQL and backend systems are where I feel most at home —  
they feed my curiosity and push me to think deeper.

## LIA – internship availability :calendar:

🗓 **LIA period:**  
**1 October 2026 – 1 December 2026**

I am highly motivated to start my LIA in an environment where:
- Backend systems matter
- Data is central
- Technology supports real business processes
- Quality and discipline are valued

---

## my long-term direction :compass:

- Backend & system development
- Data-driven solutions
- Cloud-based architectures
- Business-critical platforms (e-commerce, finance, public sector, healthcare)

I want my work to **matter**, be **used**, and be **trusted**.
